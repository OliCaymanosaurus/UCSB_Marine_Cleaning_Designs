# UCSB_Marine_Cleaning_Designs
Work with Washburn Lab

This repository contains the design files, CAD models, prototypes, and documentation for marine instrumentcleaning tools I developed in collaboration with the **Washburn Lab** at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).

My primary focus while interning at this lab was designing underwater hardware systems — including syringe holders, wire brush covers, and other cleaning mechanisms — that can be deployed and tested in marine environments to reduce dive times for maintaince and hasssle. All designs are optimized for 3D printing and underwater durability.

## 🛠 What’s Inside

- **3D CAD Models:** STL files for underwater cleaning tools.
- **Design Iterations:** Snap-fit mechanisms, U-channel holders, and other secure holding systems.
- **Prototyping Notes:** Documentation on design decisions, materials, and underwater testing.

## 🌊 About the Project

This work is part of my engineering efforts at UCSB’s Washburn Lab, focusing on developing innovative solutions for issues in their marine instruments and RADARs. I aim to create tools that are lightweight, printable, and effective in real-world underwater conditions.
