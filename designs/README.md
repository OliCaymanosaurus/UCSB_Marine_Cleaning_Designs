This folder contains the core CAD models and design files for the marine cleaning tools developed during my internship at the Washburn Lab.

Contents:
- **STL files** for 3D printing.
- Subfolders organized by project

**Note:** All files are optimized for underwater use and 3D printing on common FDM printers.
